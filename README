Very simple command line client for managing Zebra static routes from
the command line. Useful if Zebra is your route manager and you want
your DHCP client, or PPPoE client, to set default gateway dynamically
via Zebra instead of as kernel routes.

The zroute command is as far as possible command line compatible with
the regular route command from net-tools.

Please feel free to contribute additions for multiple next hops, distance
and any other missing features.
