README

Very simple command line client for managing Zebra static routes from
the command line. Useful if Zebra is your route manager and you want
your DHCP client, or PPPoE client, to set default gateway dynamically
via Zebra instead of as kernel routes.

Please feel free to contribute additions to this for metric, multiple next
hop, distance and other missing features.
